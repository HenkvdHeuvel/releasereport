# Software Release and Progress Report

Start date:  2018-04-03
End date:  2018-06-25

## Short Summary

*[Maarten van Gompel]*

A lot has happened this period and new releases have been published for most of our software, also due to the fact that
there is now [codemeta](https://codemeta.github.io/) metadata supplied with most software. The main focus for me was the
continuation of the LaMachine v2 plan, in the scope of the CLARIAH WP3 VRE project. Software metadata was an important
component in this. A portal front end (named Labirinto) that uses this metadata to display available software, has been
implemented and deployed both in LaMachine and also for CLST in general (launched at
https://webservices-lst.science.ru.nl). A lot of time was also spent on getting PICCL into production ready shape and
there has been lot of coordination with IvdNT regarding deployment of LaMachine and PICCL, fixing various bugs and
issues on the way.
